# js-movie-app

A lightweight movie browsing app built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. No frameworks, libraries, or build tools. All rendering and interaction logic is handled with simple DOM manipulation and a small event-driven structure.

The interface includes category navigation, movie cards, detailed pages, search functionality, and a basic favorites system. Visual effects such as animated borders, glass surfaces, hover transitions, and the responsive card layout are implemented manually with plain CSS.

Everything runs as static files in the browser. You can open index.html directly or launch it through the Go Live extension in VS Code for a more convenient local server experience. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate how polished a small app can be when built entirely with vanilla web technologies.
